Description
----
This extension aims to make your life a bit easier by tracking all the items
it's seen within any of your Amazon wish lists, then displaying an unobtrusive
running total price at the bottom left of your screen.

To see the total for your _entire_ list, you'll need to scroll to the very
bottom of it so all the items will load!

Change Log
----
#### 1.10.0
* Add support for Turkey and Sweden (thanks @fuzzymannerz!)
* Fix `.de` and `.se` English language URLs (thanks @fuzzymannerz!)

#### 1.9.5
* Correct calculation of amounts on amazon.co.jp (thanks @itok01!)

#### 1.9.4
* Fix 0 items/NaN total (thanks @MorbidDevil!)

#### 1.9.3
* Recognize items on (at least) https://www.amazon.de again (thanks
  @MorbidDevil!)

#### 1.9.2
* Fix bug where un-deleted items weren't being included in the total.

#### 1.9.1
* Reduce resource usage even more!

#### 1.9.0
* Reduce resource usage.

#### 1.8.0
* Support smaller screens by changing the style to conserve space when a smaller
  screen is detected.
* Support Firefox for Android!
* Show a loading spinner until all items in the current list have been parsed
  and added to the total.

#### 1.7.3
* Add support for new infinite-scrolling wish lists (needs new URL permissions
  to work on the new list URLs at `/hz/wishlist`).

#### 1.7.2
* Fix the perpetual "Calulating total..." bug (thanks to @Shakathesaint and J.
  Hobbs for helping me track this down!)

#### 1.7.1
* Prevent the total from obscuring the rest of the page during printing (thanks,
  @supertinyrobot!)

#### 1.7.0
* Amazon disabled the method we were using to determine the full wish list total
  automatically, so now you can only initially see the total for the page you're
  looking at.

  The work around is to manually page through the entire list. The extension
  will still correctly determine the total when you do this, but we can't do it
  automatically anymore :(

  I'm as sad about this as you are, believe me! I tried to find a way around
  this, but either there isn't one or I just couldn't find it. Sorry!
